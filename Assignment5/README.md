"# Assignment5"

Basic Requirements

For this assignment I will build an emulator for the basic console/interface for a simple electric
car. The car will have two doors, each one of them with a corresponding window. The
underlying concept is to implement some key activities the driver of this electric car will need to
execute in order to make the car work such as turn on the engine, turn off the engine,
accelerate, brake, set cruise control, open and close windows, open and close doors, etc
